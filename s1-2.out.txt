Scene 1: 
You carefully approach the glowing insect, trying not to scare it away. It seems unafraid of your presence, allowing you to observe its behavior closely. As you move towards it, the intensity of its glow increases dramatically, leading you to believe this might be some sort of communication or signal.

Scene 2:
With great care, you capture the insect using a net designed specifically for delicate creatures such as these. Once caught, the insect continues to emit light, though less brightly than before. This leads you to wonder if perhaps capturing it was unnecessary; could it have led you somewhere else on the island instead?

Scene 3:
After examining the captured insect under a microscope back at camp, you notice something extraordinary – tiny crystals embedded within its exoskeleton seem to react when exposed to sunlight, causing them to refract light and create the mesmerizing display. This discovery opens up possibilities about how other organisms on the island may use natural resources in unique ways.
