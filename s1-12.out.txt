Scene 1: 
You begin your ascent up the mountain, feeling the weight of curiosity pulling you forward. As you approach the midpoint, you notice an old wooden structure nestled among the trees. It looks like someone had once lived there but now it stands empty and forgotten.

Scene 2: 
Intrigued, you decide to investigate further. Stepping inside, you see signs of life; remnants of furniture, tools scattered around, even some books on shelves. But everything seems worn out, weathered by time. There’s also a map pinned onto one wall which catches your eye. It shows routes leading from this place to various locations across the island.

Scene 3: 
As you examine the map closely, something unusual catches your attention – markings along certain paths indicate hidden caverns or caves. Could these lead to undiscovered areas of the island? Your heart races at the thought of what might lie within those dark recesses. With renewed determination, you make plans to explore them tomorrow.
