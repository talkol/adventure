Scene 1: 
You approach the shipwreck cautiously, feeling both excitement and trepidation at what might lie within. As you draw nearer, you notice something unusual - there doesn't seem to be any signs of decay or rust on the hull. It looks almost as if it had been preserved somehow.

Scene 2: 
With heart pounding in anticipation, you climb aboard the wreck. Inside, everything is eerily silent except for the gentle lapping of waves against the wooden hull. There are no visible signs of life, human or otherwise. However, one thing catches your eye immediately – a large chest secured tightly shut with rusted iron bands. Could this hold answers to whoever sailed these waters before you?

Scene 3: 
After some effort, you manage to pry open the heavy lid of the chest. Your breath catches in your throat when you see what lies inside - a map! But not just any ordinary map; this one shows areas far beyond known territories, including islands never documented before. And among them...the very same island you stand on now.
