Scene 1: 
Upon reaching the abandoned hut, your heart races as curiosity takes over. With cautious steps, you enter the dilapidated structure. Dust covers every surface, but one object stands out among the decay – a weather-worn leather journal resting on a rickety table.

Scene 2: 
You pick up the journal, running your fingers along its worn edges. It belongs to someone called "Dalton". As you open it, yellowed pages flutter like birds taking flight. Your eyes scan through handwritten entries, revealing tales of adventure, discovery, and perhaps even danger.

Scene 3: 
As night falls, you sit outside the hut under the starlit sky, reading Dalton’s words by lantern light. His stories echo within these walls, filling them with life once again. But there's something else...a sense of unease creeps into your bones. What happened here? Why did he leave so abruptly? And what does his final entry hold?
