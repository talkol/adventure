Scene 1: 
You decide not to capture the strange insect but instead observe its behavior from afar. As it flies off towards unexplored territory, you notice something peculiar about its movement. It seems almost mechanical or artificial rather than natural. This intrigues you further as this could potentially lead to another discovery on the island.

Scene 2: 
As night falls, you set up camp near your base camp. Your thoughts keep drifting back to the unusual insect. Its luminescent body and rhythmic humming have left quite an impression on you. Despite being exhausted after a day full of adventure, sleep eludes you due to these lingering questions.

Scene 3: 
Finally, dawn breaks and you wake up refreshed. With renewed energy, you make plans to follow the path taken by the mysterious insect. Perhaps there might be answers hidden within those unexplored parts of the island. Excitement fills your heart at the prospect of what lies ahead.
