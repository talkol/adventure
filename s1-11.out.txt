Scene 1: 
You walk along the sandy shore, feeling the warmth from the sun on your skin as you approach the wreckage. It's a large wooden vessel, half buried in the sand, its once proud figure now weathered and worn down by time. As you draw nearer, you notice something unusual about this ship; there seems to be no sign of decay or rust despite being exposed to salt water for who knows how many years.

Scene 2: 
Carefully stepping onto the deck, you find yourself surrounded by remnants of what was once a grand sailor’s life – ropes, barrels, even pieces of armour scattered around. There's also a chest sitting atop a pile of debris, its lid slightly open revealing glints of gold within. Curiosity piqued, you kneel down to inspect further when suddenly...

Scene 3: ...a loud creaking sound echoes through the air, causing you to jump back just in time before part of the ship collapses right behind you! Realizing danger might still lurk here, you quickly make your way off the ship, leaving behind the mysterious treasure chest for another day.
