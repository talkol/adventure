Scene 1: 
You wake up early morning on your camp bed underneath the starry sky. As you stretch out, you notice something unusual; there seems to be a faint luminescent light coming from one corner of your tent. Curious, you step outside only to see the entire forest floor lit up like daylight but without any visible source of illumination. It’s eerie yet beautiful at the same time.

Scene 2: 
After breakfast, you start walking along the trail leading deeper into the heart of the jungle. Suddenly, you hear rustling sounds behind you. Turning around, you spot two pairs of yellow eyes staring back at you from within the dense foliage. They belong to creatures resembling deers except they have wings! These winged deers seem timid as they quickly disappear back into the thick vegetation. This discovery adds another unique species to your list.

Scene 3: 
As evening sets in, you return to your campsite feeling exhausted after a long day of exploration. Just then, you realize that the mysterious glowing effect has disappeared. Replacing it now is a soft twinkling of stars above which makes everything feel calm and peaceful. Despite being alone on this isolated island, surrounded by unknown dangers, somehow, tonight, you don't feel scared or lonely anymore.
