Scene 1: 
You enter the lush valley surrounded by towering trees adorned with vibrant flowers. As you walk deeper into this hidden oasis, your eyes catch sight of something unusual – a cluster of brightly colored fruits hanging from one of the trees. They seem ripe and inviting, but there’s also a sense of mystery surrounding them.

Scene 2: 
Curiosity gets the better of you as you approach the tree. With careful steps, you pluck one of the fruits off its branch. It looks delicious yet slightly intimidating due to its peculiar color scheme. Despite the uncertainty, you take a bite out of it. To your surprise, it tastes like nothing you have experienced before; sweet, tangy, and refreshing all at once.

Scene 3: 
Feeling emboldened by your first taste, you pick another fruit. This time, however, things don't go quite as smoothly. Within seconds after consuming the second fruit, you start feeling dizzy and disorientated. Your vision blurs, and everything around you seems distorted. Suddenly, you realize what was so different about those fruits...they were poisonous!
