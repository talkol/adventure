Scene 1: 
You follow the hidden path deeper into the jungle, feeling the cool air from the waterfall on your skin as you walk. As you round a corner, the sight of the vast blue lake takes your breath away. It sparkles under the sunlight filtering through the canopy above, reflecting shades of turquoise and sapphire.

Scene 2: 
Carefully stepping onto the pebbled shore, you dip one hand into the water. It feels refreshingly cold against your skin, inviting you further towards the centre of the lake. Suddenly, something catches your eye beneath the surface – a school of fish darting around what looks like a submerged cave entrance. Your curiosity piqued, you decide to explore this mysterious feature.

Scene 3: 
Equipped with snorkeling gear, you plunge into the depths of the lake. The water is clear enough for you to see every rocky crevice and coral formation below. Swimming closer to the cave entrance, you notice intricate patterns etched into the stone walls. They resemble ancient symbols or hieroglyphics, hinting at some forgotten civilization buried deep within the earth.
