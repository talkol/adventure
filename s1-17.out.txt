Scene 1: 
You enter the cave carefully, your flashlight illuminating the dark interior. As you move deeper inside, you notice something unusual on one side of the cavernous space – an intricate mural painted onto the rock face. It takes up most of the wall, stretching from floor to ceiling. Intrigued, you approach it slowly, shining your light directly at the artwork.

Scene 2:
The mural itself is breathtakingly beautiful; colors still vibrant despite their age. But what catches your attention immediately are not just the images themselves but also the series of symbols scattered throughout them. They appear to form some sort of pattern or code, yet none of these resemble any known language. Realizing this could potentially hold answers about the history of this mysterious island, you pull out your sketchbook and begin meticulously drawing every symbol, trying to capture as much detail as possible.

Scene 3:
As hours pass, you become engrossed in your work, lost in the task of translating this cryptic message. Your pencil moves swiftly across the paper, capturing each symbol with precision. Despite the difficulty of understanding the meaning behind these markings, there’s a sense of excitement building within you. This discovery might change everything we know about human civilization!
