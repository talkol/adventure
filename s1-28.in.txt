Previous chapter: After a long journey by ship, you finally reach the coordinates where the uncharted island is supposed to be. Upon arrival, you are greeted by an untouched piece of paradise filled with luscious greenery, an habitat for unknown species. You spend the next days documenting the new flora and fauna, discovering a few species unrecorded by science. While exploring, you encounter a strange insect unlike anything you've ever seen - it appears to glow and hum whenever you get closer. Deciding against capturing the insect, you watch it fly away towards unexplored terrain. Something feels odd about the way it moved. Despite not following the strange insect, you stumble upon a mysterious, ancient-looking monument. Despite your slight apprehension, you approach the monument, noticing intricate markings on the stone.
Current chapter: Touching the monument, you feel a strange sensation and faint buzzing sound. Suddenly, a hidden door in the monument opens.
Next chapter: Do you enter the hidden door?
