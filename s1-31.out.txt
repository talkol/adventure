Scene 1: 
You climb up the hill, your heart pounding as you approach the snow-white wolf pack. They seem unaware of your presence until one raises its head, sniffing the air before growling softly. Suddenly, they all turn their heads towards you, eyes gleaming like diamonds under the sunlight.

Scene 2: 
As you stand frozen on the spot, unsure whether these creatures will attack or ignore you, something unexpected happens. One of them steps forward slowly, ears perked up high, tail swaying slightly from side to side. It looks at you curiously rather than aggressively. This breaks the tension and encourages another wolf to follow suit. Soon enough, all the wolves surround you without any sign of hostility.

Scene 3: 
Intrigued by this unusual behavior, you take a step forward cautiously. To your surprise, instead of running away, the wolves respond positively. They start circling around you playfully, nudging you gently with their noses. Their fur is softer than silk beneath your fingers when you pet them timidly. For once, fear takes a backseat as you find yourself connecting with these majestic animals.
