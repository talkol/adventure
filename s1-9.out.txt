Scene 1: 
You decide against entering the mysterious cave on land and instead choose to investigate the underwater tunnel. As you descend into the water, your heart begins to pound with anticipation. The sunlight filters through the surface creating mesmerizing patterns on the ocean floor.

Scene 2: 
Swimming deeper down, you notice something unusual about this part of the sea. There seems to be less marine life than usual. However, as you swim further along the tunnel, you spot what looks like ancient ruins submerged beneath the waves. Your curiosity piqued, you decide to explore these ruins.

Scene 3: 
As you approach the ruins, they appear even older than expected. They bear markings similar to those found on artifacts from lost civilizations. Suddenly, a bright light flashes from within one of the chambers. Intrigued, you venture inside only to find yourself face-to-face with a creature unlike any other. Its skin shimmers iridescent blue while its eyes emit a soft glow. It doesn’t seem hostile, rather curious about your presence. This unexpected discovery leaves you speechless yet thrilled at having made such a remarkable discovery.
