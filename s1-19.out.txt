Scene 1: 
You emerge from the water, feeling relieved after your brief dip into the underwater tunnel. As you look around, you notice several items scattered on the beach - tools that appear to have been dropped hastily. They include a hammer, a shovel, and what looks like a small metal detector.

Scene 2: 
Curious about these abandoned objects, you approach them cautiously. The hammer catches your eye first; it seems well-worn yet sturdy enough for use. Picking it up, you feel a sudden surge of excitement as you imagine all the possibilities this tool could offer during future expeditions.

Scene 3: 
As you examine the other two items, you can’t help but wonder why they were left here. The shovel looks equally robust while the metal detector intrigues you even further. Could there be something valuable buried nearby? Or perhaps someone else had come before you seeking treasure or artifacts? Your mind races with theories, eager to explore every corner of this mysterious island.
