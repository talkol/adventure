Scene 1: 
You walk through the dense foliage, feeling the cool air brushing against your skin as you approach the peculiar rock formation. It stands tall and majestic amidst the vibrant green backdrop, its surface smooth yet intricately carved with symbols that seem familiar but impossible to decipher. As you draw nearer, you notice something unusual; there seems to be a faint luminescent glow emanating from within the rocks themselves.

Scene 2: 
Intrigued, you touch one of the stones only to feel a slight tingling sensation coursing through your fingers. Suddenly, the entire structure begins to pulsate softly, casting eerie shadows around you. Fear creeps up on you momentarily until curiosity takes over once again. With trembling hands, you trace the patterns etched onto the stone, hoping they might reveal their secret.

Scene 3: 
As you continue tracing the symbols, they start to glow brighter, illuminating the surrounding area like daylight. Incredibly, words begin forming out of thin air above the stones, written in a language unknown to mankind. Your heart races faster than ever before, realizing what this could mean – perhaps these ancient ruins hold answers to questions humanity has been asking since time immemorial.
