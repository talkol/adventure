Scene 1: 
You step forward cautiously, approaching the ancient monument. It stands tall amidst the dense foliage, casting shadows over the surrounding area. As you draw nearer, you notice that the markings etched onto its surface seem almost alive, pulsing softly as if they were breathing.

Scene 2: 
Suddenly, there's a rustling sound from behind one of the towering trees nearby. Your heart skips a beat when you see something move out of the corner of your eye. Turning around slowly, you find yourself face-to-face with another creature never before documented – this time, it’s a large reptile-like creature with scales that gleam under the sunlight filtering through the canopy above. Its eyes lock onto yours, sending chills down your spine.

Scene 3: 
Without warning, the ground beneath your feet begins to tremble violently. Panic sets in as you realize what's happening; the entire island seems to be shaking! Suddenly, cracks begin appearing all across the landscape, splitting open like giant mouths ready to swallow everything whole. In the midst of chaos, you make a decision - you must return to the ship immediately or risk being trapped here forever.
