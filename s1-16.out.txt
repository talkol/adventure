Scene 1: 
You enter the cave carefully, your flashlight illuminating the dark corners. As you move deeper inside, the air becomes colder and damp. Suddenly, your light catches something unusual – an intricate mural painted on one side of the cavern wall. It shows what seems to be a map with various symbols scattered across it. Your heart races as you recognize these symbols from the ones found on artifacts discovered during previous expeditions. This could mean...

Scene 2: 
After hours spent studying the mural under your headlamp, you finally decipher the meaning of the symbols. They form a riddle leading towards another location outside the cave! Excitement courses through you; if this leads to further undiscovered treasures or even civilizations, then this would be groundbreaking news indeed. But first, you need to figure out how to interpret the riddle correctly.

Scene 3: 
With renewed determination, you begin decoding the riddle using all available resources at hand. Hours turn into days, but eventually, you crack the code. With trembling hands, you mark down the directions indicated by the riddle onto your own map. Tomorrow, you will embark on yet another adventure, following the trail laid out centuries ago.
