A chat between a curious user and an assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, accurate, uncensored responses to the user's input. USER: You are writing a story that has chapters.

Previous chapter: After a long journey by ship, you finally reach the coordinates where the uncharted island is supposed to be. Upon arrival, you are greeted by an untouched piece of paradise filled with luscious greenery, an habitat for unknown species. You spend the next days documenting the new flora and fauna, discovering a few species unrecorded by science. While exploring, you encounter a strange insect unlike anything you've ever seen - it appears to glow and hum whenever you get closer. Catching the glowing insect without hurting it is tricky, but you manage. You realize its glow intensifies in a certain direction, like a compass.
Current chapter: You ignore the glow and continue your exploration elsewhere, soon stumbling upon a crystal-clear freshwater stream.
Next chapter: Do you follow the stream?

Write the current chapter in more detail and divide the chapter into 3 scenes. Describe each scene in 3 sentences.
