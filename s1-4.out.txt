Scene 1: 
You approach the mysterious cave entrance, feeling both excitement and trepidation. As you step inside, your torch illuminates ancient carvings on the walls depicting what could possibly be rituals or stories from centuries ago. Dust particles dance in the light as if welcoming you.

Scene 2: 
The tunnel leads deeper underground, becoming narrower and steeper. Your heart races faster than usual due to the claustrophobic atmosphere. Suddenly, there’s a loud rumbling sound echoing through the cavernous space. Rocks start falling from above, forcing you to dive out of harm's way just in time.

Scene 3: 
After regaining composure, you continue down the path, guided only by the faint glow emitted by the insect. It seems to lead towards something significant. Finally, after hours of cautious descent, you arrive at a large chamber filled with luminescent crystals hanging from the ceiling. They emit a mesmerizing display of colors, casting intricate patterns across the floor. At the center stands a massive stone tablet covered in symbols similar to those outside the cave. This must be the source of the glowing insect's guidance!
