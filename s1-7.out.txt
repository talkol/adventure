Scene 1: 
You continue your expedition through the dense jungle, guided by the sound of rustling leaves and chirping birds. Suddenly, you notice something unusual amidst the towering trees - a structure made from stones arranged meticulously, forming what looks like a pyramid. It stands out starkly against the verdant backdrop, its age evident in the weathered stonework. Curiosity piqued, you decide to explore further.

Scene 2: 
As you draw nearer to the monument, you realize there are intricate carvings etched onto the surface. They depict various creatures, some familiar while others seem alien. There are also symbols that bear no resemblance to any known language or scripture. This adds another layer of mystery to this already enigmatic place.

Scene 3: 
Intrigued by these cryptic markings, you touch one of them tentatively. As soon as your fingers make contact, a sudden rush of energy surges through you, causing you to lose balance momentarily. When you regain composure, you find yourself standing atop the pyramid, looking down at the forest floor far below. How did I end up here?, you wonder.
